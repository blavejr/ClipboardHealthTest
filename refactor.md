# I made the following changes:

- I added type checking to ensure that event.partitionKey is a string before assigning it to partitionKey
- I removed the unnecessary candidate variable and replaced all references to it with partitionKey
- I removed the condition for checking if candidate is falsy and moved the assignment of TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY to the end of the function to make the code more concise
- I added early returns to avoid having to nest multiple levels of if statements
- I added whitespace and added/removed parentheses to improve readability
- I added an initial value for the event param
- My version is more readable because it is more concise, has less nesting, and uses more descriptive variable names. It also uses early returns and type checking to make the code more clear and less error-prone.
